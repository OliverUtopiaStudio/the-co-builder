# The Co-Builder — Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 2.0 — Reviewed & Finalised
**Last updated:** 2026-02-12
**Author:** Oliver Graham-Yooll / Utopia Studio
**Status:** Active — MVP target Friday 2026-02-14

### Mission Statement

> Turn domain experts into world-leading founders with category-creating products — through a disciplined, first-principles method that takes them from invention thesis to investable company. The Co-Builder is their augmented co-founder: it meets them where they are, upskills them with modern build stacks, and creates the rigorous logic foundations that win customers and investors.

---

## 1. Purpose

The Co-Builder is an augmented co-founder — an intelligent platform that meets fellows where they are and creates a disciplined, tailored plan around them. It upskills them with modern build stacks and a systematic method that takes them from an invention thesis, through bottoms-up problem calculation, customer discovery, the creation of a richly defensible product, pricing and go-to-market strategy, all the way to being investable and understanding strategic options such as exits and novel growth strategies.

It is the central hub of Utopia Studio's venture-building programme — the single platform that spans the **entire fellow lifecycle**: from Ashby sourcing handoff, through onboarding (participation agreements, KYC, toolstack setup, compute budget), into the structured 27-asset Co-Build framework, and out the other end with a spin-out-ready company and a full data room prepared for investment committee.

It must be a **toothbrush product** — something fellows open every single day, instinctively. If it's not the first tab they reach for each morning, the product isn't working hard enough. Every session ends with a reason to come back tomorrow.

It is more than a framework tracker — it diagnoses where each venture stands, understands the fellow's knowledge and context, adapts what's required to meet them where they are, upskills them with the tools and methods they need, manages stipend payments and compute budgets, and ultimately produces the materials needed for investment committee and spin-out.

### The core problem

Before The Co-Builder, the studio's venture-building process lived across Slack conversations and Google Drive folders. There were two interrelated failures:

**For the studio team:** No way to **diagnose** where a fellow actually was — not just "which assets are complete" but "what do they understand, what's their venture's real maturity, and what's the right next step given their specific industry and context?"

**For fellows:** No clear path from day one. Fellows — many of them domain experts, not experienced builders — didn't know what good looked like, what order to work in, or how to turn their expertise into the rigorous logic that investors and customers demand.

Together, this created five systemic failures:

1. **No diagnosis or personalised planning** — Every fellow got the same generic path, regardless of their domain, maturity, or knowledge gaps. The studio team couldn't build customised plans that still delivered each required step.
2. **No systematic method** — Without a structured journey from invention → problem quantification → customer discovery → product definition → commercial model → investment readiness → strategic options, fellows worked on the wrong problems at the wrong time or skipped critical steps entirely.
3. **No upskilling pathway** — Fellows arrived with domain expertise but often lacked the build tools, analytical frameworks, and venture-building vocabulary needed to produce investable-quality outputs. There was no mechanism to equip them.
4. **Knowledge loss** — Critical insights, decisions, and reasoning were scattered across Slack and Drive with no single source of truth.
5. **No quality bar** — No mechanism to ensure venture assets met the standard needed for fundraising, customers, or stage advancement.

### How The Co-Builder solves it

The framework is fixed — 27 assets across 7 stages — but the **requirements within each asset adapt** to the venture's context. Asset #7 (Discovery Interviews) might require 20 interviews for a B2B SaaS venture but 50 for a consumer marketplace. The same rigorous methodology, tailored to each venture's reality.

The systematic method follows a deliberate arc:
1. **Invention & thesis** (Stage 00) — Validate the risk-capital thesis and category ambition
2. **Bottoms-up problem calculation** (Stage 01) — Quantify the problem with economic evidence, not assumptions
3. **Solution & defensibility** (Stage 02) — Design the invention and competitive positioning to be genuinely defensible
4. **Customer discovery** (Stage 03) — Prove demand through real customer evidence, creating the richest possible PRD
5. **Commercial engine** (Stage 04) — Build pricing, unit economics, and go-to-market strategy
6. **Investment readiness** (Stage 05) — Package the venture to be investable with institutional-grade materials
7. **Strategic options** (Stage 06) — Understand growth architecture, exit strategies, and novel strategic plays

The Co-Builder provides:
- **Diagnosis**: Meet each fellow where they are — assess across asset completion, output quality, and knowledge depth
- **Tailored plans**: Customised requirements per asset based on industry, stage, and the specific gaps identified
- **Upskilling**: Equip fellows with build stacks (Claude, Git, analytical tools) and teach them the systematic method through guided questions that provoke first-principles thinking, not compliance
- **Framework enforcement**: The 27-asset methodology is the backbone — every venture follows it, no shortcuts
- **Quality assurance**: AI and studio team review ensure outputs are investable-grade and customer-ready, not just "complete"
- **Knowledge capture**: Every insight, decision, and rationale is captured at the point of creation — nothing lost in Slack or meetings
- **Lifecycle management**: From onboarding and stipends through to data room and spin-out — one platform, no handoff gaps
- **Daily engagement**: A toothbrush product that fellows reach for every morning — every session ends with a clear next step, a pending challenge, or a reason to come back

## 2. Users

### 2.1 Fellows (Venture Builders)

Fellows are domain and industry experts. They bring deep knowledge of a problem space, market, or technology — but many have never built a venture before. The Co-Builder's job, guided by the studio team's manual inputs, is to turn them into world-leading founders with category-creating products, starting with rich bottoms-up analysis and first-principles thinking.

The experience level varies — some are first-time builders who need education on *why* each step matters, others are experienced founders who need the framework to stay rigorous, not patronising. The Co-Builder adapts its guidance level based on an experience profile set by the studio team.

Fellows need:

1. **Practical, actionable tools that take first-principles thinking to world-leading concepts** — The Co-Builder must provoke rigorous thinking and then give fellows the means to refine it into something genuinely defensible. This requires iteration and refinement with the studio team — not a one-pass form, but a back-and-forth that sharpens every asset.

2. **Speed and communication** — The ability to use the tool at pace, communicate rapidly with the studio team, and iterate without friction. Auto-save, structured questions, fast feedback loops. If the tool slows fellows down, they'll work around it.

3. **Clarity on how this takes them to spin-out** — Fellows need to see the whole journey and where they are on it. Rapid feedback and challenge from both the AI layer and the studio team — not just "you're 40% done" but "here's what's weak and here's what needs to happen before you're investable."

4. **A continuous straight line to real customers** — Everything in the framework should connect back to real customer information, real results, and real outcomes that make this a cash-generating business. The tool should never feel academic — it should feel like it's building a company.

### 2.2 Studio Team (Co-Founders & Experts)

The studio team are experts in different domains who act as co-founders to the fellows — not just administrators. While they manage the programme (onboarding, stipends, stage gates), their primary role is to actively contribute, help build, challenge thinking, and push the quality of every asset. They work across all 5-15 ventures simultaneously, switching between four modes:

- **Lifecycle management** — Onboarding new fellows (importing from Ashby, tracking agreements/KYC, setting experience profiles), managing stipend milestones and payments, configuring compute budgets, and overseeing spin-out readiness
- **Co-building** — Working directly alongside fellows on specific assets, contributing expertise, challenging assumptions, and helping refine outputs to investable quality
- **Group reviews** — Cohort-wide sessions where ventures present and the team identifies patterns
- **Async feedback** — Reviewing work in their own time, leaving comments, approving stage gates

They need:
- **Diagnostic view** — Not just "which assets are done" but "what's the quality, where are the gaps, what does this fellow need right now?"
- **Lifecycle controls** — Manage the full fellow journey: onboarding status, agreement tracking, stipend triggers, experience profiles, and spin-out readiness
- **Efficient co-building** — Drill into any venture's specific assets, contribute directly, leave targeted feedback, flag issues
- **Cohort patterns** — See where fellows get stuck collectively to improve the programme itself
- **Stage gate controls** — Formally approve advancement, or require revisions before a venture can proceed
- **Framework editing** — Modify asset content (questions, checklists, guidance) as the methodology evolves, without code changes

### 2.3 The AI Layer

The Co-Builder itself acts as a third "user" — an always-available intelligence layer that both teaches and reviews:

- **Teaches**: Helps fellows understand concepts, frameworks, and what "good" looks like — adapting to their experience level and industry context
- **Reviews from an investor lens**: Evaluates outputs as an investor would — "Would you fund this based on this evidence?"
- **Reviews from a customer lens**: Evaluates problem/solution fit — "Would a customer pay for this?"
- **Identifies quality gaps** before the studio team needs to — flagging weak reasoning, missing evidence, or inconsistencies across assets
- **Learns from patterns** across all ventures to get smarter over time

### 2.4 Future: External Stakeholders

Investors and domain experts who may need structured visibility into specific ventures or aggregated programme metrics. This is a future consideration, not a launch requirement.

## 3. The Co-Build Framework

### 3.1 Structure

The framework consists of **7 stages** containing **27 assets** total:

| Stage | Name | Assets | Purpose |
|-------|------|--------|---------|
| 00 | The Invention Gate | #1-2 | Validate the risk-capital thesis and category ambition from first principles |
| 01 | Problem Deep Dive | #3-8 | Bottoms-up problem quantification with economic evidence, not assumptions |
| 02 | Solution Architecture | #9-14 | Design a genuinely defensible invention and competitive positioning |
| 03 | Market Validation | #15-18 | Prove demand through real customer evidence — the richest possible PRD |
| 04 | Business Engine | #19-22 | Build pricing, unit economics, and go-to-market — the path to cash-generating business |
| 05 | Investment Readiness | #23-25 | Package the venture to be investable with institutional-grade materials |
| 06 | Growth Architecture | #26-27 | Strategic options — scaling systems, exit strategies, and novel growth plays |

### 3.2 Asset Anatomy

Each asset has:
- **Title** — What it is
- **Purpose** — Why it matters
- **Core Question** — The one question the asset must definitively answer
- **Checklist** — Concrete deliverables that constitute completion
- **Guided Questions** — Step-by-step workflow that produces the asset (structured as multi-step forms)
- **Key Inputs** — What's needed before starting
- **Outputs** — What this asset feeds into downstream

### 3.3 Custom Requirements

The framework is fixed (27 assets, always) but the **requirements within each asset are customisable**. Today this is managed manually by the studio team:

- **Global defaults** — Every asset has a default set of requirements and checklist items
- **Per-venture overrides** — The studio team can adjust what's required for a specific venture based on industry, maturity, and context
- **Future: AI-suggested** — Eventually the AI layer will propose custom requirements based on venture context, but the studio team always has final say

Example: Asset #7 (Discovery Interviews) has a default requirement of 15 interviews. For a B2B SaaS venture selling to CTOs, the studio team might adjust this to 20 with a note: "Focus on mid-market, 200-2000 employee companies."

### 3.4 Stage Gates

Each stage has a gate — a decision point where the studio team assesses whether the venture has earned the right to advance. This is a **human judgement call**, not an automated checkpoint:

- The studio team reviews the quality and rigour of completed assets, not just whether checkboxes are ticked
- Asset completion is a signal, but a poorly-reasoned "complete" asset can (and should) block advancement
- The studio team can approve advancement, request revisions on specific assets, or flag areas that need deeper work
- Gates are the primary mechanism for ensuring the "logic over completion" principle — a well-reasoned Stage 01 matters more than a hastily completed one

### 3.5 Framework Evolution

The 27-asset framework is still evolving — individual assets get refined, questions get sharpened, and new patterns emerge with each cohort. The tool must support this:

- The studio team can modify asset content (questions, checklists, guidance) without code changes
- Ventures that started under a previous version of the framework should not break when the framework updates
- Changes should be versioned so the team can see what changed and why

## 4. Fellow Lifecycle

Fellows have dynamic lifecycles — no two journeys are identical. The studio's mission is to help them create investable concepts and exceptionally impactful products and start-ups. The Co-Builder must adapt to each fellow's needs and take them all the way to spin-out.

The Co-Builder is the **single platform** that manages this entire journey, from the moment a fellow is accepted into the programme through to spin-out. It replaces the current patchwork of Ashby → email → Google Drive → Slack → manual tracking.

### 4.1 Lifecycle Stages

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│   SOURCED   │───→│  ONBOARDING │───→│  BUILDING   │───→│  SPIN-OUT   │───→│  GRADUATED  │
│  (Ashby)    │    │ (Co-Builder)│    │ (Co-Builder)│    │ (Co-Builder)│    │ (Completed) │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
```

**Sourced** → Fellow is identified and accepted via Ashby. Their profile data (name, email, background, domain expertise, interview notes, why they were selected) is exported into The Co-Builder. This is the handoff point.

**Onboarding** → Fellow completes all pre-build requirements inside The Co-Builder:
- Participation agreement (signed externally, status tracked in Co-Builder)
- KYC/identity verification (completed externally, status tracked)
- Experience profile (set by studio team — first-time builder / experienced founder / corporate innovator)
- Toolstack setup (guided steps to set up Claude, Git, and other tools)
- Compute budget orientation (what the $4,000 covers, recommended allocation, tool links)
- Framework introduction (what the 27 assets are, where to start, what's expected)

**Building** → The core of the lifecycle — but not a rigid march. Each fellow's journey through the 27 assets is dynamic, shaped by their domain, experience, and where the studio team identifies the highest-leverage next step. The studio team works alongside the fellow as co-founders: challenging thinking, contributing expertise, and iterating on assets until they reach investable quality. Stipend payments are triggered at admin-defined milestones. The framework provides the discipline; the studio team and fellow together provide the intelligence.

**Spin-Out** → When the framework is substantially complete and the studio team approves, the venture transitions to spin-out preparation. The Co-Builder compiles the data room: completed assets exported as structured documents, plus financial model, capital plan, and equity table.

**Graduated** → The venture has spun out. The fellow's Co-Builder record becomes an archive — read-only, available for reference.

### 4.2 Onboarding Checklist

When a fellow arrives from Ashby, they see a structured onboarding flow. Each step must be completed (or marked complete by admin) before they can begin the framework:

| Step | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Profile import** | Auto/Admin | Fellow's Ashby data is imported — name, email, background, domain, selection rationale |
| **Participation agreement** | External + tracked | Fellow signs the programme participation agreement (via DocuSign or similar). Admin marks "signed" in Co-Builder with date. |
| **KYC / Identity** | External + tracked | Fellow completes KYC (externally). Admin marks "verified" with date. |
| **Experience profile** | Admin-set | Studio team assigns: first-time builder, experienced founder, or corporate innovator. Drives guidance level throughout. |
| **Toolstack setup** | Guided in-app | Step-by-step guide to setting up: Claude (Max plan recommended), Git/GitHub basics, markdown workflow. Each tool has a description, signup link, and "I've set this up" checkbox. |
| **Compute budget** | Guided in-app | Explanation of the $4,000 compute budget. Shows recommended allocation across tools and links to each. Fellow acknowledges. |
| **Framework introduction** | Guided in-app | Interactive overview of the 7 stages and 27 assets. "Here's your journey" — adapted to their experience profile. |
| **Browser setup** | Guided in-app | Guide fellow to use Chrome's "Cast, save, and share" menu to save The Co-Builder as a shortcut on their toolbar — "This is your daily workspace." |
| **Venture creation** | In-app | Fellow creates their venture (name, description, industry, Google Drive URL). |

### 4.3 Stipend & Compute Budget

**Cash stipend: $2,500 × 2**
- Fixed amount for all fellows (same across the cohort)
- Paid at **admin-defined milestones** — the studio team sets what triggers each payment
- Examples: "Payment 1 triggered when Stage 01 is approved" or "Payment 1 at Week 4"
- The studio team configures milestones in the admin panel and manually marks payments as released
- The Co-Builder tracks: milestone definition, milestone met (date), payment released (date), amount

**Compute budget: $4,000**
- A separate budget for tools and infrastructure
- The Co-Builder provides a **recommended stack with guided spend allocation**:

| Tool | Suggested Allocation | Description | Link |
|------|---------------------|-------------|------|
| Claude Max | ~$1,200 | AI co-pilot for research, analysis, writing | claude.ai/upgrade |
| Hosting (Vercel/similar) | ~$600 | Deploy prototypes and MVPs | vercel.com |
| APIs & data | ~$800 | Third-party APIs for market data, analysis | Various |
| Design tools | ~$400 | Figma, prototyping tools | figma.com |
| Flexible/other | ~$1,000 | Domain-specific tools, testing, infrastructure | — |

- These are **recommendations, not hard limits** — fellows decide how to allocate
- The studio team can customise the recommended stack and allocations in the admin panel
- Fellows can optionally log their actual spend against categories (tracking, not enforcement)

### 4.4 Spin-Out & Data Room

When a venture completes the framework and the studio team approves spin-out readiness, The Co-Builder compiles the **data room** — everything an investment committee needs:

**From The Co-Builder (auto-generated):**
- All 27 assets exported as structured markdown documents
- Executive summary synthesised from key assets (#1, #2, #12, #23, #24)
- Progress and review history

**Additional materials (tracked, not generated):**
- Financial model (uploaded or linked)
- Capital plan / use of funds
- Equity table / cap table
- Incorporation documents
- IP assignments
- Any other pre-seed materials the studio team defines

The data room is a dedicated section within the venture view — the studio team can define what's required and track what's been completed.

## 7. Feature Roadmap

### Phase 1: Fellow Experience + Framework Flexibility (Current → MVP by Friday 2026-02-14)

Focus: Get fellows from Ashby handoff into the framework with everything they need to build at pace. Give the studio team lifecycle controls and the ability to evolve the framework without code changes.

| Feature | Priority | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Fellow onboarding + lifecycle** | CRITICAL | The full onboarding flow as defined in Section 4.2: Ashby data import, participation agreement tracking, KYC tracking, experience profile (admin-set), toolstack setup (Claude, Git, markdown — guided with links), compute budget orientation ($4,000 recommended allocation), framework introduction (adapted to experience profile), and venture creation. This is the moment we cross from Ashby sourcing to actively working with the fellow. |
| **Stipend & compute tracking** | CRITICAL | Admin panel to define stipend milestones ($2,500 × 2 at admin-set intervals), mark payments as released, and configure the recommended compute stack ($4,000 with tool categories, allocations, and signup links). Fellows see their stipend status and compute guidance in their dashboard. |
| **Admin framework editor** | CRITICAL | Studio team can edit asset content (titles, questions, checklist items, guidance text) directly from the admin UI. No code deployments needed. Framework changes are versioned. |
| **"What to work on next" guidance** | HIGH | Dashboard shows each fellow their recommended next step — not just progress bars but actionable guidance ("Start Asset #3 — you've completed the prerequisites"). |
| **Stage gate reviews** | HIGH | Studio team can formally review and approve/reject stage gates. Fellows see review status and know when they can advance. |
| **Data validation** | MEDIUM | Required fields enforcement, min/max constraints, format validation on responses. |

#### Friday MVP Cut (2026-02-14) — 3 Days

Given the Friday deadline, the MVP scope is a pragmatic cut of Phase 1. Ship these:

| Ship Friday | Defer to next week |
|-------------|-------------------|
| ✅ Fellow onboarding flow (simplified — toolstack setup, compute budget guidance, framework intro, browser setup, venture creation) | ❌ Full Ashby import (use manual fellow creation for now) |
| ✅ Admin fellow lifecycle view (see all fellows, their lifecycle stage, onboarding progress) | ❌ Agreement/KYC status tracking (track manually) |
| ✅ Admin framework editor (edit questions, checklists, guidance — no versioning yet) | ❌ Framework versioning + change notifications |
| ✅ Existing 27-asset workflows (already built) | ❌ Stipend milestone configuration |
| ✅ Experience profile on fellow record (admin-set) | ❌ Stage gate review UI |
| ✅ "What to work on next" — simple next-asset recommendation on dashboard | ❌ "What to work on next" with quality-aware guidance |

**Friday MVP success criteria**: A new fellow can sign up, complete a streamlined onboarding, start working on Asset #1, and the studio team can see their progress and edit the framework — all in the Studio OS design language, feeling like a toothbrush product they want to open every day.

### Phase 2: Review Workflows + Quality (Weeks 3-6)

Focus: Build the human review loop that ensures output quality — the primary success metric.

| Feature | Priority | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Asset comments/feedback** | HIGH | Studio team can leave inline comments on specific answers. Fellows get notified and can respond. Creates a coaching conversation within each asset. |
| **Custom requirements per venture** | HIGH | Studio team can set per-venture asset requirements from the admin UI (e.g., "This venture needs 30 discovery interviews instead of 15"). Builds on the existing `asset_requirements` table. |
| **Review status per asset** | HIGH | Each asset has a review state: draft → submitted → reviewed → approved. Studio team can request revisions with notes. |
| **Dashboard improvements** | MEDIUM | Better venture cards, recent activity feed, cohort-level overview for studio team. |
| **Markdown export** | MEDIUM | Export completed assets as markdown files with guidance on turning them into visual aids (pitch decks, one-pagers) and inputs to AI models. Simpler than PDF generation and more aligned with the fellow's toolstack. |

### Phase 3: Intelligence Layer (Weeks 6-10)

Focus: Layer AI on top of the human review workflow to improve quality at scale.

| Feature | Priority | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **AI answer review** | HIGH | AI reviews fellow responses against best practices, suggests improvements, flags weak answers before studio team review. |
| **Investor lens** | HIGH | AI evaluates assets from an investor's perspective — "Would a VC fund this based on this asset?" Learns from real investor feedback over time. |
| **Customer lens** | MEDIUM | AI evaluates problem/solution assets from a customer's perspective — "Would a customer pay for this?" |
| **Smart suggestions** | MEDIUM | AI pre-fills or suggests answers based on other completed assets (e.g., if Asset #1 describes the market failure, AI can suggest text for Asset #3's problem quantification). |
| **Quality scoring** | MEDIUM | Per-asset quality score that factors in completeness, depth, and consistency with other assets. |

### Phase 4: Ecosystem Integration (Weeks 10-14)

Focus: Connect The Co-Builder to the rest of the studio's tools.

| Feature | Priority | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Slack integration** | HIGH | Push action items from Slack conversations into venture tasks (AI-classified against 27 assets). Foundation code is already partially built. |
| **Google Drive sync** | MEDIUM | Auto-detect new documents in linked Drive folders and suggest which asset they relate to. |
| **Pitch deck generator** | MEDIUM | Auto-generate investor pitch deck sections from completed assets. |
| **Cohort analytics** | LOW | Aggregated view of cohort progress, common bottlenecks, benchmark comparisons. |

### Phase 5: Spin-Out Readiness (Weeks 14-18)

Focus: Complete the lifecycle — from framework completion to investment-ready data room.

| Feature | Priority | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Data room builder** | HIGH | Dedicated section within the venture view. Auto-generates structured documents from completed assets. Studio team defines additional required materials (financial model, cap table, incorporation docs, IP assignments). Tracks completion status of each item. |
| **Spin-out checklist** | HIGH | Admin-configurable checklist of everything needed for IC/spin-out: completed framework, data room items, legal docs, financial materials. Progress visible to both fellow and studio team. |
| **Markdown export + guidance** | HIGH | Export all completed assets as structured markdown. Include guidance on converting to pitch decks, one-pagers, and AI model inputs. Integrated with the toolstack the fellow set up during onboarding. |
| **Notification strategy** | MEDIUM | Email, in-app, and/or Slack notifications for comments, reviews, stage gate decisions, and stipend releases. |

### Phase 6: Scale & Maturity (Weeks 18+)

Focus: Support multiple cohorts and institutional learning.

| Feature | Priority | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Multi-cohort support** | HIGH | Separate cohorts with their own timelines, fellows can belong to specific cohorts. |
| **Ashby integration** | HIGH | Direct API integration with Ashby to auto-import fellow data when they're moved to "Accepted" stage. Replaces manual export/import. |
| **Template ventures** | MEDIUM | Pre-filled example ventures that show what "great" looks like for each asset. |
| **Learning system** | MEDIUM | Aggregate insights across all ventures — "What patterns do successful ventures share at Stage 03?" |

## 8. Design Principles

### North Star
> Every feature, every decision, every line of code should serve one outcome: **ensuring ventures move forward with solid logic foundations to get to customer paid engagements.**

The Co-Builder exists to make the thinking rigorous. If a venture completes all 27 assets and the logic doesn't hold up to an investor or a customer, the tool has failed.

### Principles

1. **Logic over completion** — A well-reasoned Asset #3 with genuine insight is worth more than a hastily completed Stage 01. Every feature should push towards deeper, more defensible thinking — not faster checkbox-ticking.

2. **Framework is the backbone, intelligence is the product** — The 27-asset methodology is the core IP. But what makes it a product (not just a checklist) is the intelligence layer — AI review, coaching feedback, and adaptive requirements that make each venture's path personal and rigorous.

3. **Augmented co-founder, not a form** — The tool should feel like working alongside someone who deeply understands venture-building. Guided questions should provoke thinking, not compliance. If it feels like paperwork, we've failed.

4. **Collaborative by default** — The tool serves fellows AND the studio team equally. Every feature should consider both perspectives — the fellow creating, the team coaching, the AI reviewing.

5. **Show the journey, not just status** — Progress bars are table stakes. Show *why* a venture is stuck, what the next highest-leverage action is, and how the current asset connects to the bigger picture of building a category-defining company.

6. **Central hub, not another tab** — Don't compete with Google Drive and Slack. Be the hub that connects them. Fellows should feel like The Co-Builder knows what's happening across their tools.

7. **Evolve with the programme** — The framework is still being refined. The tool must make it easy to update assets, questions, and requirements as the studio team learns what works.

8. **Integrate and export, don't isolate** — The Co-Builder must connect to Google Drive and enable fellows to export insights and outputs from day one. Over time, integrations get richer (APIs, sync, auto-detection) — but from the start, bootstrap functionality with links, exports, and manual connections. If work done in The Co-Builder can't flow into the fellow's real tools, it's trapped value.

9. **Toothbrush product** — The Co-Builder must be something fellows open every day, instinctively. During onboarding, guide them to save it as a Chrome toolbar shortcut so it's their first port of call each morning. If they're not opening it daily, the product isn't sticky enough. Every session should end with a reason to come back tomorrow — a next step, a pending review, something the studio team has challenged. Design for daily use, not weekly check-ins.

## 9. Success Metrics

### Primary: Quality of Outputs
_"Do the assets produced give this fellow the logic foundations to build a world-beating product and an investable company?"_

This is not about completion rates — it's about whether the 27 assets, when completed, contain the rigorous first-principles thinking needed to:
- Convince an investor to fund the venture
- Convince a customer to pay for the product
- Build something genuinely defensible that creates or defines its category

Measured by:
- **Studio team review scores** per asset (once review workflows are built) — does the studio team rate this as fundable/buildable quality?
- **AI quality scores** against investor and customer lenses — does the logic hold up to automated scrutiny?
- **Downstream conversion** — Do ventures that complete the framework actually raise funding, acquire paying customers, or achieve category positioning?

### Secondary Metrics
- **Logic depth**: Do responses demonstrate genuine insight and evidence, or surface-level thinking? (AI-assessed)
- **Framework adherence**: % of ventures that complete all required assets per stage before advancing
- **Time-to-quality**: How quickly do ventures reach "review-ready" quality on each asset? (Not time-to-completion — time to *good* completion)
- **Fellow confidence**: Do fellows report feeling more capable and clear about their venture after using the tool? Are they thinking in first principles and producing world-class outputs?
- **Daily usage**: Is The Co-Builder the toothbrush product — are fellows opening it daily and working actively, not weekly-checking-in?
- **Knowledge capture**: % of decisions/insights that have a documented rationale in The Co-Builder vs. being lost in Slack/meetings

## 10. Technical Decisions & Constraints

### Why Supabase + Drizzle (not Prisma, not raw SQL)
- Supabase provides auth, DB, storage, and realtime in one platform — minimal ops overhead for a small team
- Drizzle ORM gives type-safe queries with minimal abstraction — no heavy migration system needed
- The Proxy pattern for DB connection handles Vercel's serverless cold starts gracefully

### Why Server Actions + Client Components (not RSC-heavy)
- Most pages need real-time state (auto-save, progress updates) — client components are natural
- Server actions provide type-safe RPC without manual API routes
- Admin pages use client-side role checks (not middleware) to avoid DB queries in Edge runtime

### Why No Middleware Auth
- Edge middleware can't query Postgres directly (no TCP in Edge runtime)
- Supabase session cookies are validated on the client side per-route-group
- Admin role checks happen in layout.tsx (client-side redirect)

### Why Studio OS Design (not Material/Tailwind UI)
- Utopia Studio has its own design language — every tool should feel like it belongs to the same family
- Studio OS tokens: terracotta #CC5536, TWK Lausanne font, 2px borders, dark sidebar, no shadows
- Consistency builds brand trust for fellows interacting with multiple studio touchpoints

## 11. Decisions Register

All major product decisions, resolved through PRD review.

### Previously Resolved
- ✅ **Custom requirements**: Studio team sets manually per venture (future: AI suggests)
- ✅ **Framework stability**: Still evolving — admin framework editor is Phase 1 priority
- ✅ **Primary user**: Both fellows and studio team equally — collaborative by default
- ✅ **AI priority**: Phase 3 — get human review workflow right first

### Resolved in Review (2026-02-11)

1. **Stage gate criteria** — **Studio team approval only.** Asset completion is a signal, not a hard gate. The studio team decides based on their judgement whether the venture has earned the right to advance. This avoids a rigid "all checkboxes ticked" gate that conflicts with the "logic over completion" principle.

2. **Notification strategy** — **All three channels: email, in-app, and Slack.** Configurable per fellow. Email for important events (reviews, gate decisions), Slack for team visibility, in-app for everything. Notifications are a Phase 5 feature but the data model should support them from Phase 2 onwards.

3. **Multi-venture support** — **One venture per fellow.** Focus is paramount. The data model already supports multiple ventures per fellow, but the UI should emphasise the active venture. Previous ventures can be archived and revisited but not actively worked on simultaneously.

4. **Data privacy** — **Private by default, opt-in sharing.** Each venture is visible only to the fellow + studio team. Fellows can choose to share specific assets with other fellows for peer feedback. No cohort-wide visibility by default.

5. **Framework versioning** — **Notify and suggest.** When the admin edits an asset's questions or checklist, existing ventures keep their current answers intact. Fellows receive a notification that the asset has been updated, with a suggestion to review their responses against the new version. New ventures always get the latest version. The admin framework editor must store version history.

6. **Onboarding adaptation** — **Studio team sets experience profile.** During venture setup, the studio team assigns an experience profile to each fellow in the admin panel (e.g., "first-time builder", "experienced founder", "corporate innovator"). This drives the level of guidance shown — novices see educational context for each asset, experienced founders see a streamlined view.

7. **Fellow-to-fellow benchmarks** — **Not yet.** Anonymised benchmarks will be revisited once there are 20+ ventures in the system and enough data to make comparisons meaningful. For now, avoid creating comparison anxiety that conflicts with "logic over completion." The studio team can see cohort-level patterns in the admin view.

8. **Export format** — **Markdown files with toolchain guidance.** Fellows export completed assets as markdown files. The Co-Builder provides guidance on how to turn these into high-quality visual aids (pitch decks, one-pagers) and inputs to AI models (Claude prompts, analysis frameworks). The onboarding flow includes a step that gets fellows set up with a basic working toolstack: Claude, Git, and other tools needed to work effectively with their exported assets.

### Fellow Lifecycle Decisions (2026-02-11)

9. **Ashby handoff** — **Export, not live integration.** Fellow data is exported from Ashby and imported into The Co-Builder (name, email, background, domain expertise, interview notes, selection rationale). A direct Ashby API integration is a Phase 6 item. The export-import approach is pragmatic for 5-15 fellows and avoids building an integration before the data model is stable.

10. **Stipend structure** — **Fixed for all fellows: $2,500 × 2 cash + $4,000 compute.** Same amounts across the cohort — no per-fellow negotiation. The studio team defines what milestones trigger each $2,500 payment (could be stage gates, time-based, or custom). The Co-Builder tracks milestone definitions and payment release dates but does not process payments itself.

11. **Compute budget model** — **Recommended stack with links, not enforced categories.** The studio team configures a recommended tool allocation (e.g., Claude Max ~$1,200, hosting ~$600, etc.) with signup links. Fellows see this as guidance during onboarding. They can optionally log actual spend but it's not enforced. The studio team can customise the recommended stack per cohort.

12. **Participation agreements** — **Sign externally, track status in Co-Builder.** Agreements are signed via DocuSign or similar (not built into The Co-Builder). An admin marks the agreement as "signed" with a date. Same pattern for KYC — completed externally, status tracked internally. This avoids building document signing infrastructure.

13. **Payment triggers** — **Admin-defined milestones.** The studio team defines what triggers each stipend payment in the admin panel (e.g., "Stage 01 approved", "Week 4 reached", or a custom milestone). The studio team manually marks payments as released. No automated payment processing — The Co-Builder is a tracking system, not a payment system.

14. **Data room contents** — **Auto-generated assets + manually tracked additional materials.** The 27 completed assets are auto-exported as structured documents. Additional spin-out materials (financial model, capital plan, equity table, incorporation docs, IP assignments) are defined by the studio team and tracked as a checklist — fellows upload or link to each item. The data room is a section within the venture view, not a separate tool.

### Implications for Build

These decisions have several knock-on effects for the implementation:

- **Phase 1 onboarding** must include a "toolstack setup" step (Claude account, Git basics, markdown workflow)
- **Phase 1 onboarding** must include Ashby data import (manual/CSV initially), agreement/KYC status tracking, experience profile assignment, and compute budget orientation
- **Phase 1 stipend tracking** requires an admin panel for defining milestones, marking payments released, and configuring the recommended compute stack
- **Phase 1 framework editor** must store version history and trigger notifications on change
- **Phase 2 review workflow** must support the studio team as the sole gate authority (no automated pass/fail)
- **Phase 2 custom requirements** should include an "experience profile" field on the fellow record
- **Export as markdown** is simpler to build than PDF/deck generation — can ship earlier (Phase 2 instead of Phase 5)
- **Notification infrastructure** (email, Slack, in-app) should be designed in Phase 2 even if the full notification UI ships in Phase 5
- **Phase 5 data room** requires both auto-generation from assets and a configurable checklist for additional materials
- **Phase 6 Ashby integration** replaces the manual import with a direct API connection — design the fellow import interface to be source-agnostic so this is a clean upgrade
